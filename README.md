The Effects of Wheelabrator incinerator Emissions on Downwind Air Pollutant Concentrations in Baltimore City, Maryland

This repository contains code that I used to determine the  Effects of Wheelabrator incinerator Emissions on Downwind Air Pollutant Concentrations in Baltimore City, Maryland.
The code will be split up into multiple folders and sub-folders that are numbered in the order that eash cfile should be called.

This is a working repository, meaning I will continue to update this as I explore this research topic beyond my senior capstone project

Thank you for using my code as a resource!
